* A use case
  Show me every protocol that takes me from a set of known terms (kt)
  to the definition of a single unknown term (ut).
  
  Assume I know only the terms, sun, moon, rock, tree, left, right,
  up, down, light, dark, hard, soft, alive, dead, move, stop, go, now,
  then, when, who, what, where, how. You many define as many new terms as
  needed. Is there a path from those terms to an operational definition of
  'radioactive decay' such that I can determine whether some rock will
  make me dead or not if I keep it near me? What terms are missing?
  Can we find one or more minimal sets of terms that are sufficient to
  bootstrap this knowledge? Can we prove that there is a shortest path?
  Can we prove that we cannot prove that there is a shortest path?
