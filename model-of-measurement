(measure being) -> bottom
(record (omega-measure being)) -> being ; some fun comments about the computational complexity of being here...
(measure being-subset) -> symbol ; putting causal bounds on subsets...
(record symbol) -> representation
(= (alpha-record (omega-measure being-subset)) being-subset) -> #t ; subsets are implementations of the symbols of themselves
(record (measure subset)) ; science, ignoring the implementation details
(protocol s-prior) -> s-related inferred-state ; need something more for inferred-state...

measure <-agent-> movement/energy dissipation implies that any subset of the universe that takes in
energy/particle/matter and emits photos at a lower energy could be considered to be an agent (hrm... where
do black holes fit in here... something to do with the timescale of reemission... or maybe the implementation
of a measurement...)

Theorem 1: s-relevant is always bounded IF you are willing to specify a non-zero uncertainty/finite
precision. This holds for universes where the underlying reality has a finite starting point (ie not
doubly infinite in time, or where there is a (space/)time singularity a few years back) and where
there is a speed limit (c) aka where there is locality. In universes without locality this theorem
might still hold if there were something like the 2nd law of thermodynamics that prevented non-locality
from magically popping in and messing with results (a cost function with distance or something). It may
just be a requirement that the causal topology of the underlying reality be connected, meaning that
causes cannot 'jump' from one part of reality to the next without passing through the intervening bits.
Is it even possible to make measurements in non-local universes, probably, which means that simply being
able to transform s-measure into a symbol is not sufficient to satisfy T1. The intuition for this in
local, starting universes is that there is a finite amout of time that can cause events (ignoring the
future causal entanglement stuff for the moment) and the speed limit provides the classic light cone
in space that places a finite limit on the distance from which other parts of the universe can effect
each other. The evidence supporting a variety of R^2 phenomena also provide much stronger constraints
on the bounds for s-relevant. (If information can leak from one universe to the next through the starting
singularity I'm going to be super pissed here.)


; assumptions
	In the best case we want a theory of measurement to make zero assumptions about the nature of the underlying being [reality] we are trying to measure.
	Unfortunately there are some assumptions that are unavoidable when we impose measurement on being.
	All assumptions we make about the underlying nature of being in this theory are equivalent to the assumption that it is possible to take an omega-measure on being.
	Phrased another way: symbols that represent all of being are contained in the class of existences.
	(contains (omega-measure being) existence) -> #t
; implications of assumptions
	Electrons have positions and momentums at the same time, even if we cannot measure them at the same time.
	Note here that the relationship between knowability within the universe and the true nature of being are quite distinct. ; more considerations about proabalistic 'state' here... (ie that Heisenberg's is a statement about knowability/measureability not about being, see evidence that Cochlea allow humans to perform better than expected on the uncertainty principle imposted by the fourier transform)
	That it is possible to recover the string of random numbers that actually came out of the universe's RNG.

; ramblings
	We can never know whether we have obtained an omega-measure.
	The best we can hope to achieve is a relevant-measure, and
	relevant-measure is always defined by a set of axioms, not by being.
	Essentially, there is no oracle that we can use to check our answers,
	there is no revealed truth that can tell us the nature of being.

	Frank makes a good point about 'aximomatic knowability' vs 'scientific knowability'
	I disagree that being able to infer things about the structure of the universe
	prior to the big bang actually counts as being able to infer things about other universes,
	because it is not clear to me that we can *actually* consider singularities to be outside
	being (as much as I might like to for convenience sake). Certainly it wouldn't meet even
	relaxed	criteria for scientific knowability because there is no way to make a direct
	measurement on more than one member of the class of universes leaving us with the n=1 problem.

; todo
	Is it actually possible to constrain the bounds of s-relevant? Yes, but only as a function of a set of axioms (and perhaps data at some point).
	Measuring the voltage between ground and probe sticking things in between the two produces a symbol which represents an extremely complex 'state' variable, and might even be said to only refer to the state of the digitizer or the state of the transistors in the cpu, which is circular and severely unsatisfactory. In this case there is a mental model that can help constrain the problem: a circuit. However, in many cases, and certainly at the start of any new science, those models do not exist or must be imported (as axioms) from some already existing field of knowledge.
