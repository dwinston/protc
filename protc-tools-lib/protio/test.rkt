|   ; virtual particles wink in and out of being (implied has primary aspect) TODO
    ; to really make this rigorous you probably need a notion of boundedness for techniques
    ; or something like that... otherwise the time they can encompass can be very large or
    ; very small
^   ; a control measurement or calibration measurement?? no... that has the tool as an input
    ; this is a number generated from nothing, if there are inputs or outputs but they are not _primary_
    ; or rather, there are inputs or outputs, but they are not _named_ then this would be an exploratory
    ; measurement, where the only participants are the executor and secondary inputs such as a telescope
v   ; bear punch, aka the executor is just doing stuff, and or god creating the universe


|?   ; intersection of creation techniques with ??? wink in and out of being techniques?
:>   ; any creation technique isness is a valid aspect here, you need to it be able to talk about
     ; the correctness or incorrectness of the binding of a name to an instance

^?   ;
^>   ; measure a primary output, a creative measurement? the causal chain is a bit weird here?
     ; these would be the duals of destructive measurement techniques (consider time reversed systems)

v?
v>   ; basically all volume/mass/allocation techniques


?|   ; it may enter but it definitely does not leave
?^   ; measure something that might have been an input
?v   ; destroy something that was an input or wink back out of existence

>|   ;
>^   ; destructive measurement techniques such as focused ion beam EM or various calorimetry techniques
     ; the calorimetry example may fail in the absence of a control because the primary participant
     ; is not guaranteed to be isomorphic with the black box...
>v   ; killing techniques, dissolving techniques, etc. add salt to water, the solid salt is gone
     ; though some might still call it "salt water" they probably don't call it ".2 mM CaCl2 water"
?|?  ; has primary participant  + has primary aspect

?v?  ; has primary aspect actualized

>:>' ; These are our basic modifying techniques, these might also be repair techniques
>^>' ; perturbing/destabilizing measurements, e.g. measuring how long someone can run before passing out
>v>' ; these would probably cover some modifying probing techniques, as well as (verb noun) cases
     ; might also cover things like amputation "actualize the number of limbs of this person to 3" :x
     ; not quite sure where this fits in the context of allocating techniques where 10g is now gone from

?|>  ; has primary output
